<p align='left' > So why is MFA important? MFA significantly enhances security by <b><u>requiring more than just a password for access</u></b>,
 making it much harder for unauthorized users to compromise accounts </p>

<li align='left' > <u>First of all, lets talk about the first point:</u> </li>
<dl align='left' > MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring more than just a password.
 This helps protect against various attacks like phishing, keylogging, and credential leaks. 
 Even if a hacker has the user's password MFA ensures that they stay logged out due to the second authentication factor. </dl> <img src='https://www.shutterstock.com/shutterstock/photos/1898020570/display_1500/stock-vector-increasing-security-level-cyber-security-concept-wireframe-hand-is-pulling-up-to-the-maximum-1898020570.jpg' width=200 length=100 >

<li align='left' > <u>The second point:</u> </li>
<dl align='left' > MFA mitigates the risk of password-based attacks by requiring users to provide additional verification factors,
 such as a code from an authenticator app or a biometric scan. MFA can also alert users to potential unauthorized login attempts,
 allowing them to take immediate action to secure their accounts</dl> <img src='https://www.shutterstock.com/shutterstock/photos/2013671318/display_1500/stock-vector-pin-code-password-protection-concept-illustration-flat-design-vector-eps-modern-graphic-element-2013671318.jpg' width=200 length=100 >
